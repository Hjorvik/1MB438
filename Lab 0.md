What is UNIX?Unix is an operating system that was originally developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s. It is based around a "modular design" 
where tools do very distinct and narrow tasks. To complete more complex tasks multiple modules are then combined through the use of"pipes" 
-more about those later. If you are interested in learning more about UNIX then you can have a look at the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) 
for UNIX, it's quite thorough and well written.
