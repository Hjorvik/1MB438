# Lab 4 - Genome Annotation 

##### Goals of the practical session

In this lab we well continue to work on our plasmid sequence. While in Lab 3 we identified putative gene regions, in this lab we are going to use existing tools and some basic knowledge on database building to annotate it. Then, we will validate our results with some external software. 

##### Assessment of the practical session:

Try to work in the same pairs you had in Lab 3 (if you had one). As you progress, take notes of answers to the questions highlighted on this protocol on a text document or on a paper sheet. At the end of the lab, you should approach one of the teaching assistants present, and ask them to check your answers. They will discuss incorrect answers with you. Once the assistants have approved your answers, they will mark your attendance and the practical session is considered completed. If there is not time for you to present your answers, you can submit them via Studium. 

##### Preparing our session: 

For today’s lab we are going to work on Uppmax, so we’ll need to log in on our terminals and create an interactive session as we already explained in previous labs. Once we are on our interactive session, we need to run the next command to have all the modules available:

```
module load bioinfo-tools ABINIT/8.10.3 BLAST+ sqlite/3.34.0 BioPerl artemis biopython 
```
