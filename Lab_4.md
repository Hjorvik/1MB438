# Lab 4 - Genome Annotation 

##### Goals of the practical session

In this lab we well continue to work on our plasmid sequence. While in Lab 3 we identified putative gene regions, in this lab we are going to use existing tools and some basic knowledge on database building to annotate it. Then, we will validate our results with some external software.
