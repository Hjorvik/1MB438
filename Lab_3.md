# Session 3 - Identification of Coding Sequences

##### Goals of the practical session

The goal of this session is to be able to locate the functional regions of a given genome for which we don't have any previous annotation. 

##### Assessment of the practical session:

Work alone or in pairs during this lab. As you progress, take notes of answers to the questions highlighted in red in the designated black boxes, or on a paper sheet. At the end of the lab, you should approach one of the teaching assistants present, and ask them to check your answers. They will discuss incorrect answers with you. Once the assistants have approved your answers, they will mark your attendance and the practical session is considered completed. 

##### Preparing our session: 

For today’s lab we are going to work on Uppmax, so we’ll need to log in on our terminals and create an interactive session as we already explained in previous labs. Once we are on our interactive session, we need to run the next command to have all the modules available:

```
module load bioinfo-tools emboss artemis BioPerl
```

## The problem:

For this session and the next, we are going to work with a sample retrieved from a real patient in the context of an Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) outbreak. The sequence contains the complete plasmid sequence. Plasmids are small sequences of DNA present in some bacteria outside the circular chromosome, and have a huge influence on virulence, pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance.  With that in mind, we want to fully fully characterize this sequence, in order to inform the doctors of how to properly combat this new outbreak of EHEC.
