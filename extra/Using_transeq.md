# EMBOSS transeq
[Transeq](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/transeq) is a program that translates a nucleic acid sequence to a protein sequence. It is part of The EMBOSS Suite.

You can use Transeq directly at the web interface. You can also run it from the command line, if you want to install in on you own computer.

Since three nucleotides correspond to one amino acid and a nucleic acid has two strands, there are six possible translation frames. You can choose into which frame(s) you want to translate your sequence.

In the example below you see a DNA sequence and its complement in the middle. The other rows show the six possible translations. The lower part should be read from right to left. A star (*) represents a stop codon.

Since the genetic code differs between organisms, you should also choose which code you want to use.
